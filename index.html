			<p>I'm a Designer and iOS Developer who just finished his master studies. I like clean and functional designs that delight the user. Since I started developing in 2009, I have tried to incorporate those principles into my projects.</p>

			<h3>Activity Tracking</h3>
			<img src="images/DataloveIcons.png">
			<p>I started developing this app in the summer of 2013 to replace an app that was discontinued and getting unstable. I wanted something to easily keep track of my triathlon training and came up with a concept to easily track and visualize activities of any kind.</p>

			<h3>Weight Lifting</h3>
			<p>Weight lifting can be pretty complex. When I started, I noticed that simply tracking my workouts with Datalove is not nearly enough. Many existing apps weren't as beautiful and simple as i would like them to be. So I set out to develop a minimal, straight-forward app that featured strength routines of the same qualities.</p>

			<h3>Document Management</h3>
			<p>Between my Bachelor and Master I worked at a startup some of my friends founded. I developed the mobile concept, the iPhone and iPad app and helped with the API of the server. The most challenging aspects were working with OpenCV and C++ to improve camera pictures of documents and creating a reliable offline sync mechanism.</p>

			<h3>Training Tool for Orienteering Athletes</h3>
			<p>I designed and developed this app for my master thesis in 2014. Itâ€™s goal is to provide orienteers with real-time feedback during their training. I evaluated the effectiveness of the app together with beginners as well as elite athletes. After I was done, I open-sourced the project for the orienteering community to further develop.</p>
